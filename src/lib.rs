//! This is drop, a framework for distributed systems that aims to provide most of the low level plumbing
//! required when building any kind of distributed system.
//!
//! Drop provides the most common cryptographic primitives such as message signature and verification, encrypted
//! network streams, hashing and HMAC computation tools. All these are available in the [`crypto`] module.
//!
//! Drop also provides network utilities for secure communication and offers different methods for discovering and
//! connecting to remote peers in the [`net`] module.
//!
//! Drop also provides a convenient way to implement distributed algorithms and managing connections to a lot
//! of remote peers in the [`system`] module.
//!
//! Lastly drop provides a lot of testing utilites that makes it easier to test your application in the [`test`]
//! module.
